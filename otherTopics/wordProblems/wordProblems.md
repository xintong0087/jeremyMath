# Word Problems

## Introduction

Word problems are a type of problem that requires you to translate the problem into a mathematical equation.

### Example 1

Each day, Ben ate $20\%$ of the jellybeans that were in her jar at the beginning of that day. At the end of the second day, $32$ remained. How many jellybeans were in the jar originally?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 40 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 50 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 55 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 60 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 75$

## How to Translate Word Problems into Equations

Each day, Ben ate $20\%$ of the jellybeans that were in her jar at the beginning of that day. At the end of the second day, $32$ remained. How many jellybeans were in the jar originally?

### Step 1: Identify the **variables** with English&Math

Begin of day 1: $x$ jellybeans
Begin of day 2: $80\%$ of $x$ jellybeans
End of day 2: $80\%$ of $80\%$ of $x$ jellybeans, $32$ jellybeans remaining

### Step 2: Translate the Problem into an Equation

$80\%$ of $80\%$ of $x$ is equal to $32$.
$$0.8 \times 0.8 \times x = 32$$
---

### Solving the Equation

$0.8 \times 0.8 \times x = 32$

$0.64x = 32$

$x = \frac{32}{0.64} = 50$

Therefore, there were 50 jellybeans in the jar originally.

The answer is $\boxed{B}$.
