# Understanding Ratios, Fractions, and Percents

---

# What is a Ratio? ü§î
- A ratio compares two or more quantities
- Written as $a:b$ or $a/b$
- Example: In a class of 30 students, 18 are girls and 12 are boys
  - Girl:Boy ratio = 18:12 = 3:2

---

# Real-World Ratios üåé
- Recipe ingredients (2 cups sugar : 3 cups flour)
- Map scales (1 inch : 100 miles)
- Screen aspect ratios (16:9)

---

# From Ratios to Fractions ‚ûó
- A fraction is a special type of ratio
- It compares a part to the whole
- Example: In our class of 30 students
  - Girls: $\frac{18}{30} = \frac{3}{5}$ of the class
  - Boys: $\frac{12}{30} = \frac{2}{5}$ of the class

---

# Equivalent Fractions üîÑ
- Different fractions that represent the same amount
- Multiply or divide numerator and denominator by same number

---

# Introduction to Percents %
- Percent means "per hundred"
- It's a ratio comparing something to 100
- Example: $50\% = \frac{50}{100} = \frac{1}{2}$

---

# Converting Fractions to Percents
1. Convert fraction to decimal
   - Divide numerator by denominator
2. Multiply by $100$
3. Add the $\%$ symbol

### Example:
- $\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 = 75\%$

---

# Real-World Applications üåç
- Sales and discounts ($25\%$ off)
- Test scores ($90/100 = 90\%$)
- Statistics ($75\%$ of students prefer math)
- Battery life ($50\%$ remaining)

---

# Summary
- Ratios compare quantities
- Fractions are part-to-whole ratios
- Percents are ratios compared to 100
- They're all connected! üîÑ

# Practice Problems

1. If 15 out of 44 students like pizza, what percent is that?
2. Convert the ratio $32:99$ to a fraction, to a decimal, and to a percent.
3. What's bigger: $\frac{32}{81}$ or $40\%$?

# More Challenging Problems

1. Six pepperoni circles will exactly fit across the diameter of a $12$-inch pizza when placed. If a total of $24$ circles of pepperoni are placed on this pizza without overlap, what fraction of the pizza is covered by pepperoni?
