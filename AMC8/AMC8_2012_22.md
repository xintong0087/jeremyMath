# 2012 AMC8 Problem 22

Let $R$ be a set of nine distinct integers. Six of the elements are 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 14. What is the number of possible values of the median of $R$?

A. $4$

B. $5$

C. $6$

D. $7$

E. $8$

## Intuition: common strategy for all problems

When we don't know some of the quantities that are related to the problem, we can try assigning letters to the quantities.

## For this problem

Let $x$, $y$, $z$ be the three distinct integers that we don't know. Then the set becomes 

$$ R = \{2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 14, x, y, z\} $$

---

## Step 1: Find the extreme cases

$$ R = \{2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 14, x, y, z\} $$

When $x$, $y$, $z$ are all **smaller** than $2$, the median is $3$.

When $x$, $y$, $z$ are all **larger** than $14$, the median is $9$.

### Observation:

The median of this set of integers is between $3$ and $9$.

---

## Step 2: Having the freedom to choose $x$, $y$, $z$

Since we have the freedom to choose $x$, $y$, $z$ to be any integer, the median can be any value between $3$ and $9$.

Therefore, the number of possible values of the median is $9 - 3 + 1 = 7$. The correct answer is $\boxed{D}$.

### Homework:

Verify that the median can be any value between $3$ and $9$, that is, give an example of $x$, $y$, $z$ such that the median of the numbers is $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$.
