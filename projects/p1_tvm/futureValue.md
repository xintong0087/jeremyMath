# Comparing Investment Options
## How Interest Rates Affect Decisions

---

# Exercise 1: Which Option is Best?

Choose among the following options:
- Receiving $120 today
- Receiving $165 in 3 years
- Receiving $199 in 5 years

We'll analyze which option is best at different interest rates.

# Comparing at 0% Interest Rate

When interest rate = 0%, money doesn't grow over time.

| Option | Amount | Time | Future Value at Year 5 |
|--------|--------|------|------------------------|
| Option 1 | $120 | Today | $120 |
| Option 2 | $165 | 3 years | $165 |
| Option 3 | $199 | 5 years | $199 |

**Best choice: Option 3** ($199 in 5 years)

# The reason to move everything to the same time

To properly compare different investment options, we need to evaluate them at the same point in time. This is because:

1. **Time Value of Money**: Money has different values at different times due to its earning potential.

2. **Fair Comparison**: Comparing values from different time periods is like comparing apples to oranges.

3. **Decision Consistency**: Moving all options to the same time point (either present value or future value) ensures our decision is mathematically sound.

In our example, we're converting all options to their future value at year 5, which gives us a common reference point for comparison.

# Things to consider when comparing future values

- **Interest Rate**: Higher interest rates make future values more valuable.
- **Time Period**: Longer time periods allow for more compounding growth, and it is the number of years *between the present and the future reference point*. In our example:
    - Option 1: time 0 → time 5 (5 years)
    - Option 2: time 3 → time 5 (2 years)
    - Option 3: time 5 → time 5 (0 years)
- **Initial Amount**: Larger initial investments grow faster.

# Comparing at 2% Interest Rate

Let's calculate the future value of each option at year 5.

**Option 1:** $120 today
- FV = $120 × (1 + 0.02)^5 = $120 × 1.104 = $132.48

**Option 2:** $165 in 3 years
- FV = $165 × (1 + 0.02)^2 = $165 × 1.04 = $171.60

**Option 3:** $199 in 5 years
- FV = $199 × (1 + 0.02)^0 = $199

# Comparison at 2% Interest Rate

| Option | Amount | Time | Future Value at Year 5 |
|--------|--------|------|------------------------|
| Option 1 | $120 | Today | $132.48 |
| Option 2 | $165 | 3 years | $171.60 |
| Option 3 | $199 | 5 years | $199.00 |

**Best choice: Option 3** ($199 in 5 years)

# Comparing at 5% Interest Rate

Let's calculate the future value of each option at year 5.

**Option 1:** $120 today
- FV = $120 × (1 + 0.05)^5 = $120 × 1.276 = $153.12

**Option 2:** $165 in 3 years
- FV = $165 × (1 + 0.05)^2 = $165 × 1.103 = $181.95

**Option 3:** $199 in 5 years
- FV = $199 × (1 + 0.05)^0 = $199

# Comparison at 5% Interest Rate

| Option | Amount | Time | Future Value at Year 5 |
|--------|--------|------|------------------------|
| Option 1 | $120 | Today | $153.12 |
| Option 2 | $165 | 3 years | $181.95 |
| Option 3 | $199 | 5 years | $199.00 |

**Best choice: Option 3** ($199 in 5 years)

# Comparing at 10% Interest Rate

Let's calculate the future value of each option at year 5.

**Option 1:** $120 today
- FV = $120 × (1 + 0.10)^5 = $120 × 1.611 = $193.32

**Option 2:** $165 in 3 years
- FV = $165 × (1 + 0.10)^2 = $165 × 1.21 = $199.65

**Option 3:** $199 in 5 years
- FV = $199 × (1 + 0.10)^0 = $199

# Comparison at 10% Interest Rate

| Option | Amount | Time | Future Value at Year 5 |
|--------|--------|------|------------------------|
| Option 1 | $120 | Today | $193.32 |
| Option 2 | $165 | 3 years | $199.65 |
| Option 3 | $199 | 5 years | $199.00 |

**Best choice: Option 2** ($165 in 3 years)

# Comparing at 15% Interest Rate

Let's calculate the future value of each option at year 5.

**Option 1:** $120 today
- FV = $120 × (1 + 0.15)^5 = $120 × 2.011 = $241.32

**Option 2:** $165 in 3 years
- FV = $165 × (1 + 0.15)^2 = $165 × 1.323 = $218.30

**Option 3:** $199 in 5 years
- FV = $199 × (1 + 0.15)^0 = $199

# How Interest Rate Changes Our Decision

| Interest Rate | Best Option | Future Value at Year 5 |
|---------------|-------------|------------------------|
| 0% | Option 3 ($199 in 5 years) | $199.00 |
| 2% | Option 3 ($199 in 5 years) | $199.00 |
| 5% | Option 3 ($199 in 5 years) | $199.00 |
| 10% | Option 2 ($165 in 3 years) | $199.65 |
| 15% | Option 1 ($120 today) | $241.32 |

# What Did We Learn?

1. **At low interest rates:** Later payments tend to be better because money doesn't grow much over time.

2. **At higher interest rates:** Earlier payments become better because you can invest the money and let it grow.

3. **The tipping point:** In our example, the best option changes when the interest rate reaches around 10%.

---

# The Big Idea

The "best" financial choice often depends on the interest rate available to you!

- **Low interest rates** → Later money might be better
- **High interest rates** → Earlier money might be better
- **Always compare** → Calculate future values to make the best decision
