# Current Progress in Mathematics

This GitHub repository contains logs of my progress in IB MYP mathematics with Jeremy. 
Weekly meetings are held on Saturdays at 10:00 AM EST for 1 hour, where we mainly focus on **builiding the foundation** and **developing problem solving skills**.

A first assessment was given to Jeremy to test his current level of mathematics. 
Jeremy did well in most topics, but the lack of English vocabulary slightly hindered his ability to understand the questions.

We started with the topic of **geometry**. 
Most of the lecture focuses on the concept and terminologies involved in geometry, whereas Jeremy is familiar with the material. (He has learned geometry in Chinese before.)
More focus in given to problem-solving and communicating rigorous mathematics. 
Proof by contradiction is introduced, and Jeremy is able to understand the concept.
The time is not enough. 
I should focus more about the most important concepts and give more time for Jeremy to practice after class.
